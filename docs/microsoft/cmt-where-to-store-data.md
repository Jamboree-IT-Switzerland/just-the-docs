# Where do I store the data? | CMT

There are several options for storing the files from your department.  
The following overview shows you clearly where each type of data belongs:

| Location | Usage |
|----------|-------|
| **CMT \| Jamboree – Teams “General” -> department folder** | Store all files that serve as an information source for other departments here. |
| **CMT \| Jamboree – Channel folder** | Store all files that are created or edited in collaboration with other departments here. |
| **Teams area (your department only)** | Store all files that are intended exclusively for your department here. |
